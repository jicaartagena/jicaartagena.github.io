For my ICS class project in high school, our assignment was to develop an online store website. I named my store "Essentials" to align with its theme, which centered around gaming essentials. The task required including a minimum of six items, and I decided to concentrate on what are arguably the three fundamental gaming accessories: mice, keyboards, and headsets. For each category, I carefully selected two options, ensuring a diverse range to cater to different preferences and needs.

The website for "Essentials" incorporates a modern and responsive design, allowing users to seamlessly navigate and explore gaming essentials mainly mouse, keyboard, and headset. Each item on the store page is interactive, enabling users to click and delve into its dedicated HTML page. Here, they'll find a responsive embedded YouTube video review providing an in-depth look at the product. Additionally, there is a user-friendly interface that includes a button allowing customers to easily add the product to their cart, along with options to select quantities and sizes. The website also incorporates a secure sign-in and login page to enhance user accounts and experiences. While the cart functionality is currently a placeholder, users can confidently explore and add items.
