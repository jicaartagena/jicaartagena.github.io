Enchantée, French for 'Enchanted' takes you through the world of beauty, both inner and outer. The application 
follows in the footsteps of leading makeup retailer 'Sephora' allowing users to browse, click, purchase, and "heart" 
a beauty products.

<hr>

<pre>
At the moment, I've only outlined the application using CSS and JavaScript to decorate and create real-life purchasing options by using
  pictures and descriptions from sephora.com. I've added the direct links from Sephora's website to display all brand names alphabetically,
  created different categories of products such as hair care, skin care, mens car, and makeup. At the moment, the program itself displays the products
  name, image, price, and reviews. It also has different quizzes that are exactly mirrored to Sephora's real quizzes, which allow 
  beauty guru's to take quizzes about their different features to find products that are well-suited for their desires. There are also
  options to see app exclusivity, first access (for different tier levels of the reward system,) natural, limited edition, or a new drop.
  
 In it's next iternation, I hope to accomplish the following:
  -Add user functionality through JavaScript
  -Use Vercel to put CSS properties into effect
  -Make HTML files for each of the categories: hair, skin, men, etc.
  -Finish the application completely, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in conjunction to ensure dynamic user experience
