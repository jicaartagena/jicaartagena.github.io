## Rules of Sudoku 
<hr>
<pre>
1. The puzzle is played on a 9x9 grid, which is further divided into 9 3x3 sub-grids.
2. The puzzle initially contains some cells that are already filled with numbers, called "givens".
3. The objective is to fill in the empty cells with numbers from 1 to 9, such that every row, column, and sub-grid contains all of the numbers from 1 to 9.
4. No number can be repeated in the same row, column, or sub-grid.
